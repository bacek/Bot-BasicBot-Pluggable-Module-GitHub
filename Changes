Revision history for Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-GitHub

{{NEXT} 2011-????
        Bugfix: check for failure properly before attempting to announce a
        commit.  (Previously we checked we got something non-false back; if we
        asked for a commit that wasn't found, we get a hashref with an error
        key, so check for that.)

        About time this was released; it's proven itself in #dancer on
        irc.perl.org, and internally at my workplace, and I figured it would be 
        helpful to package them up and release them to CPAN for anyone else who
        would find it useful.
